Module System, for Bash.

You can install it using the script inside this repo named `install.sh`. Get the file to a place where you can execute it and execute the script as root.

For Modules, you can check the `modules` folder inside this repo. Modules inside the `modules` folder are NOT installed by default onto your system.

You can install modules at `/etc/bashmod.d/` directory to enable them for all users, or you can install them at `~/.bash_modules/` to enable them for your own user.
